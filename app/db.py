# to decode the DSN bytes as UTF-8 before establishing the connection. By
# parsing the URL up-front and passing the resulting ``URL`` object to SQLAlchemy,
# the driver receives the discrete connection arguments (user, password, host,
# etc.) directly instead of a single encoded string. This sidesteps the
# problematic decode step while keeping the configuration unchanged for callers.
